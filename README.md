# VSCode Better Memory Viewer
Is a project that is still really hackish. But right now you are able to view memory better than the default hex view. I plan to add a ton more features soon.

# How to use
Right now when you run a program in debug there is a new section called "Memory Viewer".
You can find the hex address like "0x0000ab" and it will load in a page of memory from that location.

# TODO
* Add in ability to scroll up and down "infinitely"
* Auto refresh on debug state change updates
* Allow the user to enter in variable names rather than hex address
* Test on more project types(embedded, remote, etc) and languages(C++, C, Node, Python)
* Add in more configuration settings and better readability
